			<h1>Table of contents</h1>
			
			<p>
			There are 3 Major Cryptography schemes all which use group theory.
			They build on each other from simple schemes that are hard to crack, but easy
			to compromise, to ones which are more difficult to compromise, but more mathematically
			complex and easier (relatively speaking) to crack.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Each scheme is listed in order below.  If you have experience with basic programming
			feel free to skip the "Background" section.
