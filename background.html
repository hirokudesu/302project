                <p>
                A binary string is an ordered tuple of either 0 or 1.  The number of possible
                permutation of a binary string is 2<sup>n</sup> where n is the length.
                We use binary strings to encode numbers in computers according to the formula
                
                </p>
                N=âˆ‘ b<sub>i</sub> * 2 <sup>i</sup>
                <p> When we put eight bits together they form a byte, the number 8 is not 
                intrinsically special, but it has some nice properties so we've standardized
                it to be the length of a byte.</p>

				<h2> Why are keys hard to crack</h2>
				<p>
				<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
				For a binary string (a string with combinatorial family {0,1}), the  number of possible permutations of length n is 2<sup>n</sup>. 
				The function 
				y=2<sup>x</sup> 
				grows very quickly, experiment by raising the number of bits in the demo below.
				At 64 bits the amount of time necessary to perform a brute force attack is a long time.
				In modern cryptography we use 256 bit or 512 bit keys.(Not shown here because of technical
				restrictions)
				</math>
				</p>
				<p>How long would it take to permute <input type="number" min="1" max="127" step="1" ng-model="bitCount" ng-change="computeTime()">
				bits (~{{Math.floor(bitCount/8.0)}} alphanumeric characters,~{{Math.floor(Math.pow(2,bitCount)/10.0)}} character 10-digit PIN)
				 with a processor speed of <input type="number" min="0.1"   ng-model="GHz" ng-change="computeTime()">  GHz?
				(Numbers approximate due to low javascript machine precision)</p>
				<table ng-init="computeTime()">
				<tr><th>Seconds</th><td>{{timeSeconds}}</td></tr> 
				<tr><th>Hours</th><td>{{timeSeconds/3600}}</td></tr> 
				<tr><th>Days</th><td>{{timeSeconds/(3600*24)}}</td></tr> 
				<tr><th>Years</th><td>{{timeSeconds/(3600*24*365)}}</td></tr> 
				</table>
				
				<p> In light of the above you might wonder if your credit cards and bank account are safe.
				Than answer is yes they are safe, but no they are not secure.  If you enter an incorrect PIN
				too many times when you perform a transaction your account will be frozen.  Since this occurs
				on the financial institutions servers, there is no way for a thief to circumvent this unless
				they have a privileged way or physical access to those machines.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				You might have noticed that a 4-digit pin is laughably easy to crack.  
				If your financial institutions database were ever compromised the number 
				of accounts that could be compromised
				per second would be {{(10000/GHz).toFixed(2)}}

				<h3>Challenge Questions</h3>
				
				<p>On April 22nd 2016 the FBI broke into a suspected criminals iPhone, propose a way they could have accomplished this?</p>
				<div class="challengeSoln">
					<p ng-hide="showAnswer[0]" ng-click="showAnswer[0]=true">Click to show answer</p>
					<p ng-show="showAnswer[0]" ng-click="showAnswer[0]=false">
					The iPhone will lock out/erase itself users if an incorrect password is entered too many times.
					The iPhone's ability to lock out user entry is just a piece of software easily bypassed.
					When an iPhone "erases" itself, it just forgets the key that would decrypt the device in
					combination with the correct password.  The key must necessarily be stored somewhere in the phone's
					persistant memory, in the clear.  Thus if the iPhone erases itself, the FBI need only restore this key from a copy.
					Bypassing the routine that causes the iPhone to lockout/erase itself would be relatively simple for an
					organization like the FBI, then they would only have to break the 10000 possible PINs or probably a short
					password.  If the suspect had a longer password, this might have been more difficult.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				
				<p>Suggest a reason why 64 bits is insufficient if it would take {{(_computeTime(64,GHz)/(3600*24*365)).toFixed(2)}} years to decrypt.
				Are 80 bits enough?  Why/Why not?</p>
				<div class="challengeSoln">
					<p ng-hide="showAnswer[1]" ng-click="showAnswer[1]=true">Click to show answer</p>
					<p ng-show="showAnswer[1]" ng-click="showAnswer[1]=false">
					Remember that you aren't limited to use just a single processor.  If you had 5000 for example
					it would take {{(_computeTime(64,GHz)/(3600*24*5000)).toFixed(2)}} days.
					</p>
					<p ng-show="showAnswer[1]" ng-click="showAnswer[1]=false">
					80 bits is good enough to protect against most attackers.  If the entire load of the fastest 
					super computer in the world was tasked to compute this by brute force, it would still take about 
					2 years.  The combined computing power of several super computers could decrypt faster.
					But if an encryption scheme can only be cracked by brute force, then at much more than 80 bits
					it starts to take eons for conventional computers to perform a brute force attack.  Unfortunately most cryptographic algorithms rely on primes,
					so a prime sieve can be used to perform better, at least for small primes.  Consequently we tend to choose big primes to avoid problems.</p>

                <h1>Text As Numbers</h1>

                <p>Remember that a computer can only represent numbers in memory.  A number has no intrinsic symbolic value, so
                we need to interpret them somehow.  We already know we can interpret numbers on arithmetic, but it is also possible
                to interpret them as text.  We call the textual interpretation of a number its <strong>encoding</strong>.
                An encoding maps a number to a <strong>code point</strong> which is mapped to a <strong>glyph</strong> when rendered.</p>
                
                <p>Interpretation is an important part of cryptography bare this in mind when thinking about the algorithms describes.
                For example a codepoint U+1F4A9 is defined as ðŸ’© .  On its own 1F4A9 has no meaning, but we decided that it means this cheery
                fellow, and so it does.  Similarly, all emoji codepoints map to different glyphs on different platforms.
                <a href="http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html"> This table shows the differences across various platforms</a></p>
                <p>Generally speaking for encoding english we use ASCII or UTF-8.  UTF-8 is a mode of unicode, most commonly used
                to encode international characters.  ASCII is commonly used by many programming languages, and only requires 8 bits
                per character. UTF-8 is compatible with ASCII, so typing english characters only requires 8 bits either way.
                Below is an ASCII table showing the mapping of numbers to characters.  Notice that the first column of the table is
                non printing characters, not all characters represent useful letters.
                </p>

                </div>
                </div>

                <p>A character encoding is simply a map of a number onto a letter.
               If you'd like a simpler example you can consider the mapping of numbers onto letters
               of the alphabet.</p>
